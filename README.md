# tutorials_MXSpatialDynLib
A simple tutorial of spatial dynamics library written by Xiang Meng.

This is an ultra-lightweight (32.0 KB) and user-friendly robot dynamics library, which includes solutions for kinematics, dynamics, centroidal dynamics, and various matrix computations, facilitating the research process of model-based motion planning and control for legged robots. This dynamics library does not rely on any external solver libraries. Users only need to refer to the robot construction examples provided in the functions to build their own legged robots, such as humanoid robots, quadruped robots, etc. Users do not need to concern with the solving process and they can directly obtain the desired matrices through functions.
